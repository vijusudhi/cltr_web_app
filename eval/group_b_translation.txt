The driver monitoring camera monitors the alertness and condition of the driver. It can detect distraction, drowsiness, and microsleeps and can alert the driver in time.

The driver drowsiness detection has been successful on the market for years already. It is a pure software solution without the need for additional sensors other than the steering-angle sensor. Thus it can easily be integrated into existing vehicle platforms. The function is suitable to meet the emerging legal requirements.

ACC can be activated from a speed of around 30 kilometers per hour and supports the driver especially when driving overland and on the motorway. The ACC Stop & Go variant is also active at speeds below 30 kilometers per hour. It can maintain the selected distance to the vehicle in front even at low speed and automatically brake the vehicle to a standstill. In this way, ACC Stop & Go can relieve the driver even in very dense traffic or in a traffic jam.

Hill Assist technology makes it easier to start off and maneuver on slopes. On a downhill gradient (> 3%), Hill Assist prevents your vehicle from rolling back for about 2 seconds so that you have time to switch from the brake to the accelerator pedal.

Our precise inertial measurement sensors provide reliable data for functions such as chassis controllers or electronic braking systems.

Mountain driving scenario: The system projects an image of oncoming vehicles or an obstruction that is hidden beyond a curve.

the performance of the traffic sign information can also be optimized. In this way, the system supports the future legal requirements of the General Safety Regulation (GSR) for Intelligent Speed ​​Limit Assist for the detection of speed limits and warning when the speed limit is exceeded.

The adaptive cruise control adjusts the speed to the traffic flow.

Detection of implicit and explicit speed limitation signs to inform the driver about the maximum allowed velocity. It includes detection of conditional speed limits by Supplementary Sign Optical Character Reading. Optionally, SLA can be extended to an Intelligent Speed ​​Assist (ISA) by adapting the cruise control with speed limit information from traffic sign recognition.

Intelligent Speed ​​Assistance is a system designed to assist the driver in maintaining a speed that matches the road conditions by providing targeted and appropriate feedback.

Circular area that includes parking area, meeting room, run-up, acceleration track and testing area. The circular area can be used for braking maneuvers, lane changes, driving in a circle or slalom driving. For driving in a circle, markings are provided with different radii. In addition, the area has markings for a handling course.

The lane centering assist uses the multi purpose camera generation 3 to detect lane boundaries - including road markings or structural boundaries - alongside the vehicle and compare these with the position of the vehicle in the lane. Afterwards, the system aligns the vehicle to keep it on track, making active interventions to ensure that it stays in the center of its lane.

Lane departure warning uses a video camera to detect lane markings ahead of the vehicle and warns the driver when leaving the lane.

The lane change assist works by using two corner radar sensors that are concealed in the rear bumper - one on the left, one on the right. These two sensors monitor the area alongside and behind the car. Powerful control software collates the sensor information to create a complete picture of all traffic in the area behind the vehicle.

Each tire has a sensor on the tire valve that regularly monitors the

The intake manifold air pressure and temperature sensor measures the pressure and the air temperature in the intake manifold. The micromechanical sensor contains a piezoresistive sensor element that generates a measurable electrical voltage when pressure is applied. The air pressure can be measured via the voltage. The sensor ensures an optimized fuel-air mixture for more efficient combustion.

accelerator-pedal position and any system requirements that can influence the engine torque, such as cruise control, or active safety systems such as the electronic stability program ESP®.

Traction control system (TCS) slopes with heating equipment to produce split-μ conditions

The electrohydraulic steering system Servotwin® for heavy commercial vehicles is the innovative combination of the ball nut hydraulic steering RB-Servocom® with an electronic drive and control unit. The system offers speed-dependent steering assistance with active reverse, various driver assistance functions and enables automated driving functions. The superimposed electrical circuit also replaces the previously required second hydraulic circuit for commercial vehicles with two steered axles.

from Bosch is the central control unit of the drive system and networks the individual functions into an overall system. All system information comes together here. The engine control unit processes the information via its software and controls the various function groups.
