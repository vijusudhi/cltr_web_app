With the eStroller system, Bosch offers an innovative micro-mobility solution especially for strollers. The electric drive system made up of perfectly coordinated components offers various comfort and support functions for parents. The functions include electric motor assistance when pushing up and down hills and automatic braking assistance. The handling of the system is very intuitive, without a switch on the handle. The eStroller can be connected to the associated smartphone app via Bluetooth, which enables additional functions.

Coolant switching valves control the flow of coolant in auxiliary cooling circuits of the drive train and in the heating circuits of the passenger compartment.

The electronic immobilizer secures the vehicle against theft. This is achieved by a transponder with a code in the ignition key. When the ignition is switched on, that code is read by the SMARTRA (SMART TRAnsponder, an intelligent communications interface) using an antenna. If the code is valid, the electronic immobilizer releases the engine electronics system using another coded signal required for the engine to start.

Conveyor belts and special belts for transport of bulk material in mobile machinery.

The anti-lock braking system (ABS) prevents the wheels from locking and enables safe braking.

(Anti-lock braking system) helps with safe braking and ensures shorter braking distances and a reduced risk of falling, even with abrupt braking maneuvers. the

The PEUGEOT 308 uses a camera on the top of the windshield to detect light sources. This system * automatically switches between low beam and high beam in order to adapt to the light conditions and other vehicles on the road. In this way, the system can optimize the service life of the high beam and ensure maximum safety.

The off-highway vision system consists of a central 360 ° view full HD system with four cameras and a control unit. The system enables an optimal all-round view of the field machine, the implement and the environment, despite the limited visibility. In addition, it offers a high-resolution and detailed top view of the vehicle, which supports safe and fast maneuvering even in the tightest of terrain.

The indication lamp located around the door mirror lights up when the system detects a vehicle in the blind spot area. If the driver flicks on the turn signal at that time, the indication lamp starts to flash with an audible warning to help alert the driver.

It's a typical November morning. It's cold and unpleasant outside. A visit to her aunt is overdue, but she doesn't just live around the block, so she jumps in the car. "Are you warm enough?" asks the friendly voice. "I'd like warm feet, please," she answers. The car sees to it immediately. By the time she’s reached the freeway entrance, she already feels the stress of the morning rush has faded away. Feeling good and with nice warm feet, she makes the long journey to her aunt. Who’d have thought a car could be so caring!

The parking aid extends your PEUGEOT 308 SW by a 180 ° video camera on the bonnet. You can see the surroundings of your compact sedan on your touchscreen when parking. The parking sensors are used in addition to the camera image.

The blind spot warning system detects vehicles in poorly visible areas and warns the driver with an optical signal in the event of danger.

When autonomous driving mode is activated, a set of sensors monitor the road and provide 360 ​​° surveillance of the vehicle: lidars (long-range laser scanners), long-range frontal radar, medium-range corner radar, frontal digital cameras, four 180 ° digital cameras, an ultrasound belt and more.

The steering-angle sensor is fixed onto the steering shaft, where the hub gear wheel of the sensor transmits the rotary movement of the shaft to two measuring gear wheels. In each measuring gear wheel a magnet is mounted, whose field changes its direction in accordance with the rotational movement. Below each magnet, a GMR sensor element is located to detect the angle position of the magnet above. The analog values ​​of the GMR elements are converted into digital information directly on the circuit, which is then sent to the microprocessor via serial interface.

With Automated Valet Parking, vehicle manufacturers can already offer the automated driving experience. The system is based on the sensors used in the infrastructure, which recognize pedestrians and other objects in the route. In this way, the vehicle reliably comes to a stop if there is an obstacle.

The start-up information system helps to avoid collisions with heavy commercial vehicles and other road users directly in front of the motor vehicle.

With automatic emergency braking on cyclists, car exit warning and predictive pedestrian protection, Bosch introduces driver assistance systems to complex urban traffic scenarios. These smart systems protect especially pedestrians and cyclists who are at most risk.

The Intelligent Forward Collision Warning system uses a radar sensor located in the front of the vehicle to detect the distances between the two cars ahead, as well as their relative speed. This allows the system to assess the situation in front of the vehicle. If the system determines that the vehicle needs to slow down due to a sudden change with the vehicles ahead, it prompts the driver by blinking the vehicle ahead detection indicator and sounding an audible alert.

The driver observation camera records the attention and condition of the driver. Distraction, tiredness or microsleep can be recorded and the driver can be warned in good time.

The driver drowsiness detection helps to avoid accidents caused by drowsiness by recommending a break to the driver in good time.
